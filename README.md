This is my first game project! And therefore its my first python game project!

I didn't place venv in github. Run a piece of code. Each first line tells you why. Each second line tells you how. 

If you want to create venv like I did. You would need these files and run this code in the root of the project.
python3 -m venv venv

Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

And you also need to install the requirements from the txt file\n
pip install -r requirements.txt
