This is my first game project! And therefore its my first python game project!

I didn't place venv in github. If you want to recreate the environment look at "recreate_environment.sh"


This was created as part of the boot.dev python project which had us make asteroids. The latest push at 1/16/2025 is a carbon copy of what I created as part of it. Anything after that, is of my own pure creation.
I do like the ideas that they have on how to expand on this project, and I plan on working on it more. Heres the list:

[1] Add a scoring system
[2] Implement multiple lives and respawning
[3] Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
[4] Add acceleration to the player movement
[5] Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
[6] Add a background image
[7] Create different weapon types
[8] Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
[9] Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
[10] Add a shield power-up
[11] Add a speed power-up
[12] Add bombs that can be dropped
