This is my first game project! And therefore its my first python game project!

I didn't place venv in github. If you want to recreate the environment look at "recreate_environment.sh"


This was created as part of the boot.dev python project which had us make asteroids. The latest push at 1/16/2025 is a carbon copy of what I created as part of it. Anything after that, is of my own pure creation.
I do like the ideas that they have on how to expand on this project, and I plan on working on it more. Heres the list:

Add a scoring system
Implement multiple lives and respawning
Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
Add acceleration to the player movement
Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
Add a background image
Create different weapon types
Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
Add a shield power-up
Add a speed power-up
Add bombs that can be dropped
